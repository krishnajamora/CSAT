DeepCSAT â€“ Ecommerce Customer Satisfaction Prediction
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning project to predict customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) based on e-commerce platform data. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and explainability.

Project Overview
Predict customer satisfaction score (CSAT Score) from transactional, behavioral, and categorical data.

Perform thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.

Conduct hypothesis testing relevant to business questions.

Train and tune a Random Forest Classifier.

Explain model predictions using SHAP values.

Provide a saved model ready for deployment.

Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher

Recommended: Virtual environment to isolate dependencies
